If TaskInfo is split across two pages in memory, you need to ensure that you handle the write operation carefully to avoid overwriting or misaligning memory. When dealing with volatile memory, particularly in embedded systems programming where this scenario might occur, you typically want to ensure that the write operation is atomic and that it properly handles the split across pages.

One way to handle this situation is to break down the write operation into two separate writes: one for each page. Here's an example of how you might handle this:

```rust
use core::ptr;

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct TaskInfo {
    // fields
}

fn main() {
    let mut volatile_address_start: *mut TaskInfo = /* starting address of the first page */;
    let mut volatile_address_end: *mut TaskInfo = /* starting address of the second page */;

    // Create the TaskInfo instance to be written
    let task_info = TaskInfo {
        // initialize fields
    };

    unsafe {
        // Write the first part of TaskInfo to the first page
        ptr::write_volatile(volatile_address_start, task_info);

        // Calculate the address for the second part of TaskInfo
        let task_info_second_part_address = (volatile_address_end as usize)
            .wrapping_sub(std::mem::size_of::<TaskInfo>());

        // Get a pointer to the second part of TaskInfo
        let volatile_address_second_part =
            task_info_second_part_address as *mut TaskInfo;

        // Write the second part of TaskInfo to the second page
        ptr::write_volatile(volatile_address_second_part, task_info);
    }
}
```
In this example:

We assume TaskInfo is split across two pages.
We perform two separate writes, one for each page.
For the second write, we calculate the address for the second part of TaskInfo and write it to the second page.
This approach ensures that each part of the structure is written to the correct page, avoiding potential issues with split memory. However, depending on your specific memory layout and requirements, you may need to adjust this approach accordingly.
